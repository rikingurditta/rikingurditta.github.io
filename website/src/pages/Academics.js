                                        and the assingments were kinda cool. On top of learning the basics of C and
                                        systems programming, we also learned a tiny bit about how we deal with
                                        messages being broken up as they're sent over a network. We used this to
                                        implement a command line-based message board. Fun stuff.

                                        This was my favourite class of the Fall 2020 semester. I learned a lot! We
                                        started with simulating deformable bodies made of springs, then learned how to
                                        use the finite element method to simulate continuous materials. We used this to
                                        simulate some pretty realistic-looking cloth! Then we simulated rigid bodies,
                                        which were pretty tricky. For my final project, my partner and I made a pretty
                                        crappy fluid simulator. <NewTabLink

                                        This course was great! I learned a lot about point-set topology, and got a nice
                                        taste of algebraic topology. The professor, <NewTabLink href="https://malors.com/"

                                        was tough on us but he really cared about our learning.

                                        I took these courses because I planned on studying physics if I didn't get into
                                        CS. However these courses kinda taught me that physics isn't my thing. I like
                                        it, but it's pretty spooky. I'll stick to math.
